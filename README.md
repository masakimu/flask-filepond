# flask-filepond
tiny sample of flask application to upload file using  filepond javascript library.
I modified style-sheet to put filepond between forms (but not completed).

to test the sample, just run following commands in your python virtual environment: 

```shell:
 $ pip install -r requirement.txt
 $ python sample_form.py
```
then, you can see the sample web from http://localhost:8001/
